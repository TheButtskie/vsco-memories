### Things to do:
- [ ] add user select for delay between images
- [x] resize image to only take up portion of screen [still work in progress to make it cleaner]
- [ ] add repeating through images
- [ ] randomly select images 
- [ ] add vs logo + other asthetics
- [ ] add time slider to only select certain subset of images to look at (highcharts)
- [ ] animations for images appearing
- [ ] add waiting during video clips

##### Ideas (not in the pipeline)
- [ ] add support for collections + journals?
- [ ] gif summary support to your timeline?
