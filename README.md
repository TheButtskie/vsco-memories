## Finished Features:
- Set the interval between images
- Loop through a user's images
- Randomly show a user's images


### Things to do (Bugs + Features):
- [x] resize image to only take up portion of screen [still work in progress to make it cleaner]
- [ ] [grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Auto-placement_in_CSS_Grid_Layout) vs. single view
- [ ] add vs logo + other asthetics
- [ ] add waiting during video clips (allow clips to fully play)
- [ ] fix if user wants to edit settings while previewing ~ currently won't update system
- [ ] add time slider to only select certain subset of images to look at (highcharts) [(noUiSlider)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4753946/html5-slider-with-two-inputs-possible)

##### Ideas (not in the pipeline)
- [ ] add support for collections + journals?
- [ ] animations for images appearing > requires additional time delay
- [ ] gif summary support to your timeline?
