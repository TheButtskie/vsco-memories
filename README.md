## Finished Features:
- A single page of images (no scrolling)
- A grid and portait viewing style 
- Set the interval between images
- Loop through a user's images
- Randomly show a user's images


### Things to do (Bugs + Features):
- [ ] adjust grid and portrait view [breakpoints]
- [ ] search bar bugs? [make sure it works + clears userinfo?]
- [ ] enhance settings asthetics
- [ ] fix if user wants to edit settings while previewing ~ currently won't update system


##### Ideas (not in the pipeline)
- [ ] add waiting during video clips (allow clips to fully play)
- [ ] add support for collections + journals?
- [ ] animations for images appearing > requires additional time delay
- [ ] gif summary support to your timeline?
- [ ] add time slider to only select certain subset of images to look at (highcharts) [(noUiSlider)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4753946/html5-slider-with-two-inputs-possible)
