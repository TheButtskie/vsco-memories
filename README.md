## Finished Features:
- Loop through a user's images
- Randomly show a user's images

### Things to do (Bugs + Features):
- [ ] add user select for delay between images
- [x] resize image to only take up portion of screen [still work in progress to make it cleaner]
- [ ] add vs logo + other asthetics
- [ ] add time slider to only select certain subset of images to look at (highcharts)
- [ ] animations for images appearing > requires additional time delay
- [ ] add waiting during video clips (allow clips to fully play)
- [ ] fix if user wants to edit settings while previewing ~ currently won't update system
- [ ] fix popup menu not disappearing when not hovering over it

##### Ideas (not in the pipeline)
- [ ] add support for collections + journals?
- [ ] gif summary support to your timeline?
